# ldk-swift

Automatic Swift bindings generation for [`rust-lightning`](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning).

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager
To install using Swift Package Manager, add the following line to the depedencies array of your `Package.swift`:
```
.package(url: "https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-swift/", exact: "0.0.115")
```
Be sure to also include "LightningDevKit" into your packages target like so:

```
targets: [
    .target(
        name: "YourPackage",
        dependencies: [
            .product(name: "LightningDevKit", package: "ldk-swift")
        ]),
    ...
]
```

If you're importing directly into Xcode, just copy and paste `https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-swift/` into the system dialog when you click "Add Package..."

### Manual Installation
In order to use the automatically generated bindings, simply drag `*.xcframework` file into an Xcode project.

The `*.xcframework` files are either available on
the [Releases](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-swift/releases) page, or can be [compiled](#Compilation)
from scratch.

## Compilation

### Prerequisites

-   A machine running macOS
-   [Xcode](https://xcodereleases.com/)
-   [Python3](https://programwithus.com/learn/python/install-python3-mac)
-   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
-	[NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
-   [GNU sed](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gnu-sed) (optional, but will cut your compile times significantly!)

For Rust specifically, there are a couple additional requirements that can be installed once the Rust toolchain
is set up:

```shell
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios
cargo install cbindgen
```

### Cloning Dependencies

In order to generate these bindings from scratch, you will need to clone two dependency repositories:

**[rust-lightning](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning)**, (a specific branch built for bindings compatibility):

```shell
git clone --branch 2023-04-0.0.115-java-bindings https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/rust-lightning /path/to/rust-lightning
```

**[ldk-c-bindings](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-c-bindings)**:

```shell
git clone --branch v0.0.115.0 https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-c-bindings /path/to/ldk-c-bindings
```

Take note of where you clone these directories, it's best you save the absolute path somewhere handy for the rest of the remaining steps.

### Generating Rust-to-C-bindings

Now, navigate to the `ldk-c-bindings` directory and run the `genbindings.sh` script:

```shell
pushd path/to/ldk-c-bindings
./genbindings.sh /path/to/rust-lightning true
popd
```

### Generating C-to-Swift-bindings

<details>
<summary>If using Docker</summary>

If you're using Docker to generate the Swift bindings, navigate (if you're not already there from the
previous step) to the `ldk-c-bindings` directory and open the file located here:

`/path/to/ldk-c-bindings/lightning-c-bindings/Cargo.toml`

In that file, you will see four lines specifying the `lightning`, `lightning-persister`, `lightning-invoice`, and
`lightning-background-processor` dependencies. They will most likely show local paths to the `rust-lightning`
folder due to the previous `genbindings.sh` step. As Docker won't have access to local paths,
replace those lines with the following:

```yaml
lightning = { git = "https://github.com/thebluematt/rust-lightning", branch = "2023-04-0.0.115-java-bindings", default-features = false }
lightning-persister = { git = "https://github.com/thebluematt/rust-lightning", branch = "2023-04-0.0.115-java-bindings", default-features = false }
lightning-invoice = { git = "https://github.com/thebluematt/rust-lightning", branch = "2023-05-0.0.115-java-bindings", default-features = false }
lightning-background-processor = { git = "https://github.com/thebluematt/rust-lightning", branch = "2023-04-0.0.115-java-bindings", default-features = false }
lightning-rapid-gossip-sync = { git = "https://github.com/thebluematt/rust-lightning", branch = "2023-04-0.0.115-java-bindings", default-features = false }
```

You will note that the revision is unspecified and is currently just placeholder `xxx`s. To obtain the revision,
just navigate to the just clone custom `rust-lightning` directory and run:

```shell
cd /path/to/rust-lightning
git rev-parse HEAD
```

Take that commit hash and replace the `xxx` instances with it.

</details>

#### Generating the Swift files

To generate the Swift files, navigate to the `ldk-swift` repository and run the following:

```shell
export LDK_SWIFT_GENERATOR_INPUT_HEADER_PATH="/path/to/ldk-c-bindings/lightning-c-bindings/include/lightning.h"
npm i && npm run tsc && node ./src/index.mjs
```

Now, the contents of `./ci/LDKSwift/Sources/LDKSwift/bindings` will have been completely regenerated.

#### Updating Swift files in Xcode project

To make sure the correct bindings files are referenced in the project, open `./xcode/LDKFramework/LDK.xcodeproj`.

In the sidebar, navigate to the `LDK/bindings` group, and delete it by removing references.

Then, open a Finder window, and drag the `bindings` folder (`./ci/LDKSwift/Sources/LDKSwift/bindings`) into the same location in Xcode that you just deleted.

Finally, make sure you leave the "Copy items if needed" box unchecked, and pick at least `LightningDevKit` as a target to add the references to. Depending on what you intend to do later on, it's easiest to simply add it to all the targets.

### Building requisite binaries

Navigate (`cd`) to the `./scripts` folder, and run the following Python script:

```shell
python3 ./build_bulk_libldks.py /path/to/ldk-c-bindings
```

This command will take a while, but it will eventually produce a set of binaries for all the
platform/architecture combinations we're trying to support. Those binaries should adhere to the
`./bindings/bin/release/<platform>/` folder pattern.

Each of those folders will contain an `architectures` directory with subdirectories such as `arm64`
or `x86_64`, as well as a `libldk.a` file, which is the `lipo` product of all the targeted
architectures.

### Generating the \*.xcframework files

With all the binaries generated, still in the `./src/scripts` directory, you just need to run one
last Python script to produce the framework:

```shell
python3 ./generate_xcframework.py /path/to/ldk-c-bindings
```

Once the script finishes running, you should see `LightningDevKit.xcframework` in the
`./bindings/bin/release` folder. Drag that into your project, and you're done!
